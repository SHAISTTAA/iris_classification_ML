# 🌸 Simple Iris Flower Classification (ML Project)

A beginner-friendly Machine Learning project demonstrating the core data science pipeline to classify Iris flower species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To build a model that can predict the species of an Iris flower (**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**) based on its four physical measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook** (for step-by-step analysis)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data handling)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization/EDA)
* **Scikit-learn** (Model training and evaluation)

## 📈 Key Findings
* The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) clearly shows that the **Petal Width and Petal Length** are the most effective features for separating the three species.
* The KNN model achieved an accuracy of **[Your Accuracy Score]%** on the test dataset.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1.  **Clone the Repository** to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
    ```
3.  **Open the Notebook:** Open the file `iris_classification.ipynb` in VS Code.
4.  **Execute Cells:** Run all the code cells sequentially from top to bottom (Shift + Enter).
